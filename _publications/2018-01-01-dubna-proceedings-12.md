title: "Single pion production in neutrino-nucleon scattering studied with FORM package"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-01-01-dubna-proceedings-12
excerpt: 'Two models for the single pion production induced by interactions of the neutrinos with the nucleons are studied. The nonresonant background contribution is a subject of analysis. It is shown that the normal component of the polarization of the charged lepton is sensitive on the nonresonant background contribution. It is also demonstrated that the FORM language can be utilized to evaluate all necessary transition matrix elements and the single pion production cross sections.'
