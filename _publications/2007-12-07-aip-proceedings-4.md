excerpt: 'New vector and axial form factors in the Rein‚ÄêSehgal model are proposed. The vector part is constructed after experimental fits of the helicity amplitudes for electroproduction of Œî(1232) resonance. The axial part is calculated after ùëÑ2 distribution of events in the ANL experiment.'
