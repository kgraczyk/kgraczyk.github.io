excerpt: 'The statistical properties of the density map (DM) approach to counting microbiological objects on images are studied in detail. The DM is given by U2-Net. Two statistical methods for deep neural networks are utilized: the bootstrap and the Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. The detailed analysis of the uncertainties for the DM predictions leads to a deeper understanding of the DM model s deficiencies. Based on our investigation, we propose a self-normalization module in the network. The improved network model, called Self-Normalized Density Map (SNDM), can correct its output density map by itself to accurately predict the total number of objects in the image. The SNDM architecture outperforms the original model. Moreover, both statistical frameworks -- bootstrap and MC dropout -- have consistent statistical results for SNDM, which were not observed in the original model.'
