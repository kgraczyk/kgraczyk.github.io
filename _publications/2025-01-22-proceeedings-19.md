excerpt: 'In this article, we highlight physics improvements in the NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. The upcoming version of NuWro will incorporate the integration of the argon spectral function for quasi-elastic scattering, along with the MINERÎ½A parametrization of the axial form factor. Additionally, the new release will feature the implementation of the Valencia 2020 model for meson exchange current. The previously used simplistic delta resonance model for single-pion production will be replaced by a more accurate Ghent hybrid model in the upcoming version of NuWro. We also discuss the recent advancements made by the Wroclaw Neutrino Group in applying machine-learning techniques to achieve model-independent reconstruction of lepton-nucleus interactions'
