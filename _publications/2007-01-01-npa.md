title: "Quark-hadron duality in the Rein-Sehgal model"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2007-01-01-npa
excerpt: 'The quark-hadron duality in CC and NC neutrino interactions is discussed under assumptions that single pion production is described accurately by the Rein-Sehgal model and that it allows reconstruction of the inclusive cross section in the resonance region. The duality is measured by means of integrals of structure functions in the Nachtmann variable for Q2<3Q^2<3Q2<3 GeV2^22. The results depend on the precision with which contributions from single pion production channels in the overall cross sections are known. Several approaches to evaluate them are compared. The duality is predicted to be seen for proton target reactions and to be absent for neutron and isoscalar targets. Two-component duality between resonant and valence quark contributions to structure functions is also investigated.'

__Abstract:__ The quark-hadron duality in CC and NC neutrino interactions is discussed under assumptions that single pion production is described accurately by the Rein-Sehgal model and that it allows reconstruction of the inclusive cross section in the resonance region. The duality is measured by means of integrals of structure functions in the Nachtmann variable for Q2<3Q^2<3Q2<3 GeV2^22. The results depend on the precision with which contributions from single pion production channels in the overall cross sections are known. Several approaches to evaluate them are compared. The duality is predicted to be seen for proton target reactions and to be absent for neutron and isoscalar targets. Two-component duality between resonant and valence quark contributions to structure functions is also investigated.
