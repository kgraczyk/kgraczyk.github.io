excerpt: 'Quark-hadron duality in neutrino-nucleon reactions is investigated under the assumption that cross sections in the resonance region are given by the Rein-Sehgal model. The quantitative analysis of the duality is done by means of appropriate integrals of the structure functions in the Nachtmann variable. We conclude that with the definition of the resonance region W∈(M+mπ,2W\in (M+m_{\pi}, 2W∈(M+mπ​,2 GeV) the duality holds for neutrino-proton reaction F2F_2F2​ structure function for Q2∈(0.5,3)Q^2\in (0.5, 3)Q2∈(0.5,3) GeV2^22 and it is absent for neutrino-neutron reaction.'
