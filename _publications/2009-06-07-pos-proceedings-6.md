excerpt: 'This talk presents some of the results of the re-analysis of [Graczyk et al.] of the bubble chamber data for single pion production induced by neutrino scattering off deuteron. It is shown that ANL and BNL data are statistically consistent. The validity of the Adler relations (between P33(1232) resonance axial form factors) is also investigated.'
