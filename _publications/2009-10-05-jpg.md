excerpt: 'We present predictions for the value of the cross section ratio σ(e+p → e+p)/σ(e−p → e−p), determined from our fit of the elastic ep cross section and polarization data. In this fit, we took into account the phenomenological two-photon exchange dispersive correction. The cross section ratios which are expected to be measured by the VEPP-3 experiment are computed. The kinematical region which will be covered by the E04-116 JLab experiment is also considered. It is shown that for both experiments the predicted cross section ratios deviate from unity by more than 3σ.'
