excerpt: 'We present new superalgebra for N=2 D=3,4 supergravity theory endowed with the U(1) generator. The superalgebra is rooted in the so-called Soroka-Soroka algebra and spanned by the Lorentz Jab and Lorentz-like Zab, translation Pa and T generators, as well as two supercharges QIÎ±. We construct a corresponding 3D Chern-Simons supergravity realization of the superalgebra and discuss its relevance.'
