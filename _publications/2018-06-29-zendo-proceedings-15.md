excerpt: 'Polarization transfer (PT) observables in the single pion production induced by the charged current neutrino-nucleon interaction are examined within two models. The predictions are made for neutrino energy of the order of 1 GeV as well as for the T2K energy flux. It is demonstrated that the PT observables: the degree of polarization and the polarization components of outgoing fermions are sensitive to the details of the nonresonant background model. It is shown that the normal component of the polarization of the outgoing nucleon and the charged lepton are determined by the interference between the resonant (RES) and nonresonant (NB) amplitudes. Moreover, the sign of the normal component of the polarization of the charged lepton is related to the relative sign between the RES and the NB amplitudes. The presentation is based on: Phys.Rev. D97 (2018) no.1, 013001, and Acta Phys.Polon. B48, 2219 (2017).'
