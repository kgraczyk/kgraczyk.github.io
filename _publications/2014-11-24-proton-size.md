excerpt: 'The methods of Bayesian statistics are used to extract the value of the proton radius from the elastic ep scattering data in a model-independent way. To achieve that goal a large number of parametrizations (equivalent to neural network schemes) are considered and ranked by their conditional probability P(parametrization|data) instead of using the minimal error criterion. As a result the most probable proton radii values (rpE=0.899±0.003 fm, rpM=0.879±0.007 fm) are obtained and systematic error due to freedom in the choice of parametrization is estimated. Correcting the data for the two-photon-exchange effect leads to smaller differences between the extracted values of rpE and rpM. The results disagree with recent muonic atom measurements.'
