title: "Relevance of Two Boson Exchange Effect in Quasi-Elastic Charged Current Neutrino-Nucleon Interaction"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2014-05-01-tbe
excerpt: 'Two-boson exchange (TBE) correction in νn→l−p and ν¯p→l+n reactions is estimated. The TBE contribution is given by Wγ box diagrams. The calculations are performed for 1 GeV neutrinos and for the MiniBooNE and the T2K energy spectra. The TBE correction to the total cross section is of the order of 2–4% (with respect to the Born contribution) in the case of νe and ν¯e and 1–2% in the case of νμ and ν¯μ .'
