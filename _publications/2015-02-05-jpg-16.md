excerpt: 'The Bayesian approach for the feed-forward neural networks is reviewed. Its potential for usage in hadron physics is discussed. As an example of the application, the study of the two-photon exchange effect is presented. We focus on the model comparison, the estimation of the systematic uncertainties due to the choice of the model and the over-fitting. As an illustration, the predictions of the cross sections ratio ${\rm d}\sigma ({{e}^{+}}p\to {{e}^{+}}p)/{\rm d}\sigma ({{e}^{-}}p\to {{e}^{-}}p)$ are given together with the estimate of the uncertainty due to the parametrization choice.'
