excerpt: 'Neutrino-oscillation experiments performed in the few-GeV energy region create an urgent demand for a significant improvement in the accuracy of modeling of neutrino interactions with atomic nuclei. Here, we report an updated implementation of the spectral function approach in the \nuwro{} Monte Carlo generator, which consistently treats multinucleon final-states in quasielastic scattering at the inclusive and exclusive level. After validating its accuracy against inclusive electron-scattering data, we compare its predictions to various neutrino cross sections from MicroBooNE. We find that with the multinucleon contribution, these data are reproduced with χ2 per degree of freedom of 1.3--1.8, compared to 2.7--7.2 without it.'
