excerpt: 'We constructed a new Monte Carlo generator of events for neutrino CC single pion production on free nucleon targets. The code uses dynamical models of the DIS with the PDFs modified according to the recent JLab data and of the Delta excitation. A comparison with experimental data was done in three channels for the total cross sections and for the distributions of events in invariant hadronic mass.'

__Abstract:__ We constructed a new Monte Carlo generator of events for neutrino CC single pion production on free nucleon targets. The code uses dynamical models of the DIS with the PDFs modified according to the recent JLab data and of the Delta excitation. A comparison with experimental data was done in three channels for the total cross sections and for the distributions of events in invariant hadronic mass.
