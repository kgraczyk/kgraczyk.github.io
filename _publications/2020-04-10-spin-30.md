title: "Spin asymmetries in quasielastic charged current neutrino-nucleon scattering"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-04-10-porous-30
excerpt: 'The work concerns the quasielastic charged current neutrino-neutron and antineutrino-proton interactions. Single, double, and triple spin asymmetries are computed and analyzed. The spin asymmetries are sensitive to the axial form factor of the nucleon. In particular, the target-recoil double spin asymmetry and the lepton-target-recoil triple spin asymmetry depend strongly on the axial form factor of the nucleon. Indeed, the sign and shape of these components depend on the axial mass parameter. All the asymmetries, except the lepton polarization, are observables well suited to study the nonstandard interactions described by the second-class current contribution.'

__Abstract:__ The work concerns the quasielastic charged current neutrino-neutron and antineutrino-proton interactions. Single, double, and triple spin asymmetries are computed and analyzed. The spin asymmetries are sensitive to the axial form factor of the nucleon. In particular, the target-recoil double spin asymmetry and the lepton-target-recoil triple spin asymmetry depend strongly on the axial form factor of the nucleon. Indeed, the sign and shape of these components depend on the axial mass parameter. All the asymmetries, except the lepton polarization, are observables well suited to study the nonstandard interactions described by the second-class current contribution.
