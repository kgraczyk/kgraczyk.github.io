excerpt: 'Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are utilized to encode the relation between initial configurations of obstacles and three fundamental quantities in porous media: porosity (𝜑), permeability (k), and tortuosity (T). The two-dimensional systems with obstacles are considered. The fluid flow through a porous medium is simulated with the lattice Boltzmann method. The analysis has been performed for the systems with 𝜑∈(0.37,0.99) which covers five orders of magnitude a span for permeability 𝑘∈(0.78,2.1×105) and tortuosity 𝑇∈(1.03,2.74). It is shown that the CNNs can be used to predict the porosity, permeability, and tortuosity with good accuracy. With the usage of the CNN models, the relation between T and 𝜑 has been obtained and compared with the empirical estimate.'

__Abstract:__ The work concerns the quasielastic charged current neutrino-neutron and antineutrino-proton interactions. Single, double, and triple spin asymmetries are computed and analyzed. The spin asymmetries are sensitive to the axial form factor of the nucleon. In particular, the target-recoil double spin asymmetry and the lepton-target-recoil triple spin asymmetry depend strongly on the axial form factor of the nucleon. Indeed, the sign and shape of these components depend on the axial mass parameter. All the asymmetries, except the lepton polarization, are observables well suited to study the nonstandard interactions described by the second-class current contribution.
