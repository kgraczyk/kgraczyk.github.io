__Abstract:__ The algebraic solution of RPA equations nucleon re-interactions in the case of quasi elastic charged current neutrino - nucleus scattering is presented. Abelian algebra of matrices allows to extract four independent corrections to cross section separatly.Results of numerical computations are shown.
