excerpt: 'The elastic and inelastic neutral current Nu (Anit Nu) scattering off the polarized nucleon is discussed. The inelastic scattering concerns the single-pion production process. We show that the spin asymmetries measurement can help to distinguish between neutrino and antineutrino neutral current scattering processes. The spin asymmetries also encode information about a type of target. Eventually, detailed studies of the inelastic spin asymmetries can improve understanding of the resonant-nonresonant pion production mechanism.'
