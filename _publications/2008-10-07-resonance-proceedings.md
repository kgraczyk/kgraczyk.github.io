excerpt: 'Single pion production in neutrino-nucleon scattering is discussed. The neutrino energies characteristic for T2K project are considered. Two new parameterizations of C_5^A axial form factor are proposed. Both of them are obtained in simultaneous fit to ANL and BNL data. One of them (which fits better to BNL data) leads to d\sigma/dQ^2 
differential cross section which is significantly reduced at low Q^2.'

#__Abstract:__ Single pion production in neutrino-nucleon scattering is discussed. The neutrino energies characteristic for T2K project are considered. Two new parameterizations of C_5^A axial form factor are proposed. Both of them are obtained in simultaneous fit to ANL and BNL data. One of them (which fits better to BNL data) leads to d\sigma/dQ^2 
differential cross section which is significantly reduced at low Q^2.
