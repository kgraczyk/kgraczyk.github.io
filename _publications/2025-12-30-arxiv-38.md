permalink: /publication/2025-12-30-arxiv-38
excerpt: 'Recent experimental data from MINERvA on transverse kinematics observables across four different nuclear targets - carbon, oxygen, iron, and lead - have been utilized to refine the modeling of final state interaction effects in the NuWro Monte Carlo neutrino event generator. For this purpose, we have developed an event reweighting tool for future applications to adjust the strength of final-state interactions. This study highlights the requirement for stronger nucleon reinteractions than previously assumed, but it still falls within the uncertainty range observed in a study comparing proton transparency measurements. This conclusion has significant implications for both experimental and theoretical work involving NuWro.'
