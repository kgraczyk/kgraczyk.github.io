excerpt: 'We utilize transfer learning to extrapolate the physics knowledge encoded in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model trained on synthetic charged-current (CC) neutrino-carbon inclusive scattering data. This base model is adapted to generate CC inclusive scattering events (lepton kinematics only) for neutrino-argon and antineutrino-carbon interactions. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of transfer learning in re-optimizing a custom model when new data comes from a different neutrino-nucleus interaction model. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly outperforms training generative models from scratch. To study this, we consider two training data sets: one with 10,000 and another with 100,000 events. The models obtained via transfer learning perform well even with smaller training data. The proposed method provides a promising approach for constructing neutrino scattering event generators in scenarios where experimental data is sparse.'
