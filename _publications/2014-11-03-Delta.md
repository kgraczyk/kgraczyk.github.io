excerpt: 'Nucleon→Δ(1232) transition electroweak form factors are discussed in a single pion production model with nonresonant background terms originating from a chiral perturbation theory. Fits to electron-proton scattering F2 as well as neutrino scattering bubble chamber experimental data are performed. Both ν-proton and ν-neutron channel data are discussed in a unified statistical model. A new parametrization of the N→Δ(1232) vector form factors is proposed. In the case of model with deuteron nuclear effects fit to neutrino scattering data gives the axial mass MAΔ=0.85+0.09−0.08  GeV and CA5(0)=1.10+0.15−0.14 in accordance with the Goldberger-Treiman relation. However, the consistency is spoiled when the deuteron effects are omitted; i.e., in this case the fit gives the axial mass MAΔ=0.81+0.09−0.09  GeV and CA5(0)=0.93+0.13−0.13.'
