title: "Local density and the RPA corrections in charge current quasielastic neutrino on oxygen, argon and iron scattering"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2004-01-26-arxiv
excerpt: 'Numerical computations of cross sections for quasielastic charge current scattering of neutrino on Oxygen, Argon and Iron in Local Density Approximation (LDA) are presented. We consider processes for a few GeV neutrino energy. We include corrections from nucleon re-interaction in nucleus described by relativistic Random Phase Approximation (RPA). We adopt the relativistic Fermi gas model of nucleus with and without taking into account the effective mass of nucleons.'
