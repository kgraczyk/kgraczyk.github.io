excerpt: 'We propose a new approach to simulate neutrino scattering events as an alternative to the standard Monte Carlo generator approach. Generative adversarial neural network (GAN) models are developed to simulate neutrino-carbon collisions in the few-GeV energy range. The models produce scattering events for a given neutrino energy. GAN models are trained on simulation data from \nuwro{} Monte Carlo event generator. Two GAN models have been obtained: one simulating only quasielastic neutrino-nucleus scatterings and another simulating all interactions at given neutrino energy. The performance of both models has been assessed using two statistical metrics. It is shown that both GAN models successfully reproduce the event distributions.'
