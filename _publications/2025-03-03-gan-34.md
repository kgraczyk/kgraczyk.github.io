excerpt: 'We propose a new approach to simulate neutrino scattering events as an alternative to the standard Monte Carlo generator approach. Generative adversarial neural network (GAN) models are developed to simulate charged current neutrino-carbon collisions in the few-GeV energy range. We consider a simplified framework to generate muon kinematic variables, specifically its energy and scattering angle. GAN models are trained on simulation data from Monte Carlo event generator. Two GAN models have been obtained: one simulating quasielastic neutrino-nucleus scatterings and another simulating all interactions at given neutrino energy. The models work for neutrino energy ranging from 300 MeV to 10 GeV. The performance of both models has been assessed using two statistical metrics. It is shown that both GAN models successfully reproduce the distribution of muon kinematics.'
