title: "NuWro Monte Carlo generator of neutrino interactions - first electron scattering results"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-11-01-Nuwro-proceedings
excerpt: 'NuWro Monte Carlo generator of events is presented. It is a numerical environment containing all necessary ingredients to simulate interactions of neutrinos with nucleons and nuclei in realistic experimental situation in wide neutrino energy range. It can be used both for data analysis as well as studies of nuclear effects in neutrino interactions. The first results and functionalities of eWro — module of NuWro dedicated to electron–nucleus scattering — are also presented.'
