excerpt: 'Numerical results for the degree of polarization of τ− produced in (CC) neutrino - nucleon Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) are presented. Calculations are done in the threshold region, where the τ− scattered by the small angles and can be partially polarized. The cross sections and polarization are calculated by using the GRV98 parton distributions functions (PDF's) and the GRV98 with modifications of A. Bodek at.al. [Nucl. Phys.

#__Abstract:__ Numerical results for the degree of polarization of τ− produced in (CC) neutrino - nucleon Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) are presented. Calculations are done in the threshold region, where the τ− scattered by the small angles and can be partially polarized. The cross sections and polarization are calculated by using the GRV98 parton distributions functions (PDF's) and the GRV98 with modifications of A. Bodek at.al. [Nucl. Phys. B Proc.(Suppl) 112 (2002) 70].
