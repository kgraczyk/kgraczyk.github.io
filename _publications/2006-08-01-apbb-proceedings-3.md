excerpt: 'An analysis of the Rein-Sehgal model in the context of the quark--hadron duality hypothesis is presented. The resonance region structure functions reconstructed from the Rein--Sehgal model at different values of QRES2Q^2_{\rm RES}QRES2​ are compared with the DIS structure functions calculated at higher QDIS2Q^2_{\rm DIS}QDIS2​. The ratios of corresponding integrals in the Nachtman variable are also calculated and presented as functions of QRES2Q^{2}_{\rm RES}QRES2​. The obtained functions are approximately flat for QRES2>0.5Q^2_{\rm RES}>0.5QRES2​>0.5\,GeV2^22 but the quark--hadron duality is not observed.'
