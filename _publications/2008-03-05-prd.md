excerpt: 'Vector and axial form factors in the quark resonance model are analyzed with a combination of theoretical and phenomenological arguments. The new form of form factors is deduced from Δ(1232) excitation models and available data. The vector part is shown to agree with the resonant contribution to electron-proton inclusive F2 data. The axial part is obtained by finding a simultaneous fit to ANL and BNL dσ/dQ2 neutrino scattering data. The best fit corresponds to CA5(0)=0.88 in the Rarita-Schwinger formalism.'

__Abstract:__ Vector and axial form factors in the quark resonance model are analyzed with a combination of theoretical and phenomenological arguments. The new form of form factors is deduced from Δ(1232) excitation models and available data. The vector part is shown to agree with the resonant contribution to electron-proton inclusive F2 data. The axial part is obtained by finding a simultaneous fit to ANL and BNL dσ/dQ2 neutrino scattering data. The best fit corresponds to CA5(0)=0.88 in the Rarita-Schwinger formalism.
