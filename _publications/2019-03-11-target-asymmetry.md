excerpt: 'The single pion production (SPP) in the charged-current neutrino (antineutrino) scattering off the polarized nucleon is discussed. The spin asymmetry is predicted within two approaches. The spin polarizations of the target nucleon that are longitudinal and perpendicular to the neutrino momentum are considered. It is shown, in several examples, that information about the SPP dynamics coming from the spin asymmetry is complementary to information obtained from measurements of spin averaged cross section. Indeed, the spin asymmetry is sensitive to the nonresonance background description of the SPP model. For the normal polarization of the target, the spin asymmetry is given by the interference between the resonance and the nonresonance contributions.'
