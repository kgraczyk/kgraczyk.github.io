excerpt: 'Different approaches to take into account nonzero lepton mass effects in the Rein-Sehgal model are compared. Modification of the axial current due to a pion pole term is included, and it is shown that it leads to large reduction of the antineutrino cross section and a change of the shape of dσ/dQ2.'

__Abstract:__ Different approaches to take into account nonzero lepton mass effects in the Rein-Sehgal model are compared. Modification of the axial current due to a pion pole term is included, and it is shown that it leads to large reduction of the antineutrino cross section and a change of the shape of dσ/dQ2.
