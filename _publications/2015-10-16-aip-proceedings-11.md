title: "Electroweak single pion production and form factors of the Δ(1232) resonance"

permalink: /publication/2015-10-16-aip-proceedings-11
excerpt: 'We extend and review our analysis of the nucleon → Δ(1232) transition electroweakform factors from Ref. [1]. New fit of the Δ(1232) vector form factors to electron-proton scattering F2 structure function is introduced as well, leading to results different from the popular parametrization of Ref. [2]. A clear model dependence of the extracted parameters emerges. Fit to neutrino scattering data is performed in all available isospin channels. The resulting axial mass is MAΔ=0.85−0.08+0.09(GeV)and C5A(0)=1.10−0.14+0.15. The latter value is in accordance with Goldberger-Treiman relation as long as the deuteron effects are included.'
