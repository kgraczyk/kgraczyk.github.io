excerpt: 'A careful reanalysis of both Argonne National Laboratory and Brookhaven National Laboratory data for weak single pion production is done. We consider deuteron nuclear effects and normalization (flux) uncertainties in both experiments. We demonstrate that these two sets of data are in good agreement. For the dipole parametrization of CA5(Q2), we obtain CA5(0)=1.19±0.08, MA=0.94±0.03  GeV. As an application we present the discussion of the uncertainty of the neutral current 1π0 production cross section, important for the T2K neutrino oscillation experiment.'

#__Abstract:__ A careful reanalysis of both Argonne National Laboratory and Brookhaven National Laboratory data for weak single pion production is done. We consider deuteron nuclear effects and normalization (flux) uncertainties in both experiments. We demonstrate that these two sets of data are in good agreement. For the dipole parametrization of CA5(Q2), we obtain CA5(0)=1.19±0.08, MA=0.94±0.03  GeV. As an application we present the discussion of the uncertainty of the neutral current 1π0 production cross section, important for the T2K neutrino oscillation experiment.
