title: "Single pion production (SPP) in neutrino interactions with nucleons "
excerpt: "Single pion production (SPP) induced by neutrino-nucleon scattering is one of the processes used to measure the neutrino oscillation parameters. We have proposed several improvements in the theoretical description of the SPP. Inpapers [Phys. Rev. D77, 053001](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.77.053001) and [Phys. Rev. D77, 053003](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.77.053003), a new scheme for modeling resonance form factors in the Rein-Sehgal model and an algorithm for implementing the lepton mass effects were proposed. Several experimental Monte Carlo generators, including NEUT implemented our results. In [Phys. Rev. D 80, 093001](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.80.093001), we studied the ANL and BNL data for SPP. For the first time, it was shown that both data sets are consistent, contrary to what was claimed before in previous analyses. In [Phys.Rev.  D80,  093001](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.80.093001),  and [Phys.  Rev.  D90,  093001](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.90.093001),  we  obtained  new parametrizations for the weak nucleon-Delta excitation transition matrix element.
