title: "Polarization asymmetries in neutrino scattering off nucleon"
excerpt: "   
<br> The main goal of the project was to study the information content of the polarization asymmetries in: 
 * <b>quasielastic (QE)</b> charged current (CC) neutrino (antineutrino) neutron (proton) scattering [Phys.Rev.D 101 (2020) 7, 073002](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.101.073002), and [Acta Phys.Polon.B 50 (2019) 1771](https://www.actaphys.uj.edu.pl/index_n.php?I=R&V=50&N=11#1771); 

 * <b>weak (CC) pion production (SPP)</b> in the neutrino (antineutrino) - nucleon scattering, [Phys.Rev.D 97 (2018) 1, 013001](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.97.013001), [Phys.Rev.D 99 (2019) 5, 053002](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.99.053002), [Phys.Rev.D 104 (2021) 3, 033005](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.033005), and [Acta Phys.Polon.B 48 (2017) 2219](https://www.actaphys.uj.edu.pl/index_n.php?I=R&V=48&N=12#2219)

The project was done with Beata Kowal.

Target spin asymmetry and double and triple spin asymmetries have been studied for the first time for the QE scattering. We showed that double spin asymmetries and triple spin asymmetry contain information about the axial content of the nucleon and are perfect observables for measuring the axial form factor of the nucleon.

One of the problems in modeling the SPP in neutrino-nucleon interactions is a proper description of the resonant (RES) and non-resonant (NR) contribution to the neutrino scattering cross-sections. We showed that the target spin asymmetries and recoil nucleon polarization contain nontrivial information about the interference of resonant and non-resonant amplitudes. In particular, we showed that measurement of the target spin asymmetries might carry out the information about the relative phase between RES and NR amplitudes as well as the NR amplitudes. We study the sensitivity of spin asymmetries on the parameters of the N-Delta(1232) weak transition model.
