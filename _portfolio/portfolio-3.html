title: "Deep learning in porous media"
excerpt: "In paper <a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-78415-x'>Sci. Rep 10, 21488 (2020)</a>, we proved the deep learning systems' ability to encode  information  about  porous  media  fluid  dynamics.  We  adapted  the convolutional neural networks (CNN) to relate initial configurations of obstacles, represented by a picture, with three fundamental quantities in the porous media: porosity, permeability, and tortuosity. We showed that our CNN reproduces the values of porosity, permeability, and tortuosity with reasonable accuracy.
