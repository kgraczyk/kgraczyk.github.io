title: "Electromagnetic and weak structure of the nucleon studied within Bayesian neural network methods"
excerpt: "We adapted and developed the Bayesian neural network (BNN) approach to study nucleon's  electroweak  internal  structure.  
This  method  allows  reducing  the dependence of analysis results on model assumptions. 
In paper <a href='https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP09%282010%29053'>JHEP 09, 053 (2010)</a>, we obtained a new parametrization of 
the proton and neutron's electromagnetic form factors, and in <a href='https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.99.025204'>Phys.Rev.C 99 (2019), 025204</a> an analogous study was done for the axial form factor. 
The latter paper showed that neutrino-deuteron scattering data do not contain enough information to study non-dipole corrections. 
In papers <a href='https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.84.034314'>Phys. Rev. C84, 034314</a>; <a href='https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0954-3899/42/3/034019'>J. Phys. G42, 034019</a>, we studied the two-photon exchange effect. 
In paper <a href='https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.88.065205'>Phys. Rev. C88, 065205</a> results of the BNN approach were compared to the quantum field theoretical computations. 
Finally, in <a href='https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.90.054334'>Phys. Rev. C90, 054334</a>, we used the Bayesian objective algorithm to calculate the charged proton radius. 
In addition to the papers' results, BNN C++ library (written from scratch by K. Graczyk and C. Juszczak) resulted from this study.
