title: "Superalgebras for Supergravity"
excerpt: "

<br/>
The project aims to find the superalgebra structure that describes intrinsic symmetry. We start from the Poincare and Anti-de Sitter structures. We extend the primary structures by exploiting the so-called resonant construction by adding additional symmetry generators. We analyze millions of superalgebra candidates to find the generator configurations that obey the Poincare or AdS-like super structures pattern. The successful superalgebra structures must satisfy the Jacobi identities. 

* In Eur.Phys.J.C 82 (2022) 3, 254, we obtained symmetry algebras, evaluated within an efficient pattern-based computational method implemented in Wolfram Mathematica. These supersymmetric extensions of algebras, going beyond the Poincaré and Anti-de Sitter ones, contain additional bosonic generators Z_{ab}Zab​ (Lorentz-like), and U_aUa​ (translational-like) added to the standard Lorentz generator J_{ab}Jab​ and translation generator P_{a}Pa​. Our analysis includes all cases up to two fermionic supercharges, Q_{\alpha }Qα​ and Y_{\alpha }Yα​. The delivered plethora of superalgebras includes a few past results and offers a vastness of new examples. The list of the cases is complete and contains all superalgebras up to two of Lorentz-like, translation-like, and supercharge-like generators (JP+Q)+(ZU+Y)=JPZU+QY(JP+Q)+(ZU+Y)=JPZU+QY. In the latter class, among 667 founded superalgebras, 264 are suitable for direct supergravity construction. For each of them, one can construct a unique supergravity model defined by the Lagrangian. As an example, we consider one of the algebra configurations and provide its Lagrangian realization.

* In Phys.Lett.B 833 (2022) 137366, we present new superalgebra for N=2D=3,4 supergravity theory endowed with the U(1) generator. The superalgebra is rooted in the so-called Soroka-Soroka algebra and is spanned by the Lorentz Jab and Lorentz-like Zab, translation Pa, T generators, and two supercharges QαI. It is the only possible realization for a given generator content. We construct a corresponding 3D Chern-Simons supergravity realization of the superalgebra and discuss its relevance.
