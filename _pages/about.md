Shortly
======
I work at the [Institute of Theoretical Physics](https://www.ift.uni.wroc.pl), [Wroclaw University](www.uni.wroc.pl). 

I am interested in particle, nuclear and computational physics. I am also an enthusiast of new computationals technologies such as Deep Learning and Quantum Computing.



Topics of my research activity
======
    * neutrino-nucleon/nuclei interactions
    * electromagnetic and weak structure of nucleon
    * machine learning in particle and nuclear physics
    * Bayesian statistics
    * symbolic programming
    * deep learning in fluid dynamics
