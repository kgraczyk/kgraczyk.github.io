Shortly
======
I work at the [Institute of Theoretical Physics](https://www.ift.uni.wroc.pl), [Wroclaw University](www.uni.wroc.pl). 

I am interested in particle, nuclear and computational physics. I am also an enthusiast of new computationals technologies such as Deep Learning and Quantum Computing.



Topics of my research activity
======
  * neutrino-nucleon/nuclei interactions
  * electromagnetic and weak structure of nucleon
  * machine learning in particle and nuclear physics
  * Bayesian statistics
  * symbolic programming
  * deep learning in fluid dynamics
  * Machine Learning in MC simulations of neutrino interactions


Available Ph.D. or MSc. topics
====== 
A) Deep learning in Physics
The project concerns studies and applications of deep learning methods in physics. Three directions of research are distinguished:
  * Deep learning systems studied within quantum field theory tools;
  * Deep learning methods in Monte Carlo simulations of neutrino-nuclei;
  * Deep learning methods in quantum mechanics;

B)  Physics of Neutrino-Nucleon Interactions. The project concerns two aspects:
  * Model dependence in neutrino-nucleus and nuclei scattering. 
  * Single Pion Production in Neutrino-Nucleon Scattering
