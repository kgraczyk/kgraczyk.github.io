Shortly
======
* I work at the [Institute of Theoretical Physics](https://www.ift.uni.wroc.pl), [Wroclaw University](www.uni.wroc.pl). 

* I am interested in particle, nuclear and computational physics. I am also an enthusiast of new computationals technologies such as Deep Learning.

* I am an author of publications in the following arxiv categories: hep-ph, hep-th, hep-exp, nucl-th, nucl-ex, physics.comp-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn, physics.flu-dyn, cs.lg, stat.ML


Current Projects I am involved in
======
  * Deep Learning for neutrino interactions with nuclei
  * Bayesian Neural Networks for Partial Differential Equations
  * Deep Learning for Physics of Fluids
  * Algebraic Structures for SuperGravity


Available Ph.D. or MSc. topics
====== 
A) Deep learning in Physics
The project concerns studies and applications of deep learning methods in physics. Three directions of research are distinguished:
  * Deep learning for neutrino interactions;
  * Physics-informed, guided and inspired Neural Networks
  * Teaching physics neural networks
