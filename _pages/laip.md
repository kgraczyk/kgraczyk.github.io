_Group of physicists keen on applications and development of AI methods for theoretical, computational, and experimental physics_

* _We work on applications of AI techniques in the physics of fluids, nuclear and particle physics, and supergravity._
* In particular, we focus on the development of:
    * Deep learning models for studies of porous media
    * Machine learning models for Monte Carlo simulations of neutrino-nucleus scattering
    * Bayesian methods for the analysis of electron and neutrino scattering data
    * Hopfield-like models
    * PINN in Bayesian approach
* [The list of papers obtained within the initiative](https://kgraczyk.github.io/dlphysics/)

* 14.03.2025:
  * title: __Generative adversarial neural networks for simulating neutrino interactions__, speaker: dr L. Bonilla
    ```
    Abstract: We propose a new approach to simulate neutrino scattering events as an alternative to the standard Monte Carlo generator approach. Generative adversarial neural network (GAN) models are developed to simulate neutrino-carbon collisions in the few-GeV energy range. Two GAN models have been obtained: one simulating only quasielastic neutrino-nucleus scatterings and another simulating all interactions at given neutrino energy, trained on NuWro Monte Carlo simulation. The performance of both models has been assessed using two statistical metrics, and it is shown that both GAN models successfully reproduce the event distributions from the training data set.

  * title: __AI in Academia__, speaker: dr R. Durka
    ```
    Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape teaching and scientific research. We will explore real-world applications of AI tools, from improving various academic aspects and optimizing workflows to enhancing scientific exploration. I will also highlight recent developments and features, including new tools like Canva, voice-enabled AI, autonomous AI agents, deep research, and recent reasoning models.
