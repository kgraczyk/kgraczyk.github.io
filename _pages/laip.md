_Group of physicists keen on applications and development of AI methods for theoretical, computational, and experimental physics_

* _We work on applications of AI techniques in the physics of fluids, nuclear and particle physics, and supergravity._
* In particular, we focus on the development of:
    * Deep learning models for studies of porous media
    * Machine learning models for Monte Carlo simulations of neutrino-nucleus scattering
    * Bayesian methods for the analysis of eletron and neutrino scattering data
    * Hopfield model
    * PINN-like approach
* [The list of papers obtained within the initiative](https://kgraczyk.github.io/dlphysics/)
