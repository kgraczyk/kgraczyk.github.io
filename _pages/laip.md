_Group of physicists keen on applications and development of AI methods for theoretical, computational, and experimental physics_

* _We work on applications of AI techniques in the physics of fluids, nuclear and particle physics, and supergravity._
* In particular, we focus on the development of:
    * Deep learning models for studies of porous media
    * Machine learning models for Monte Carlo simulations of neutrino-nucleus scattering
    * Bayesian methods for the analysis of electron and neutrino scattering data
    * Hopfield-like models
    * PINN in Bayesian approach
* [The list of papers obtained within the initiative](https://kgraczyk.github.io/dlphysics/)

  * title: __Recent progress on applications of machine learning in nuclear physics__, speaker Amir Jalili (Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, China)
    **Abstract:** In this lecture, we explore the conceptual and practical intersection of machine learning (ML) with scientific domains, particularly nuclear physics. It begins by framing the brain as a biological model for ML, then establishes a foundation in core statistical concepts like Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Bayesian estimation, discussing their respective roles in data-rich and data-sparse scenarios. The talk further uses advanced ML architectures, including neural networks, and distinguishes between two powerful paradigms for integrating scientific knowledge: Physics-Guided ML (PGML) and Physics-Informed ML (PIML). It also covers optimization techniques and common algorithms. Finally, the presentation concludes with forward-looking suggestions for prospective research, proposing novel applications of ML and hybrid models in nonlinear dynamics, highlighting the transformative potential of ML as a tool for discovery across diverse scientific fields.

  * title: __Automated Machine Learning and Interactive Apps from Notebooks – Tools for Physicists__, speaker: dr Piotr Płoński ([MLJAR](https://mljar.com), Inc.)
    
    **Abstract:** In this talk, I will show how physicists can use automated machine learning (AutoML) tools to quickly build models from data. I will present MLJAR-supervised – an open-source AutoML tool that automatically creates models, selects the best one, and generates easy-to-read reports.

    I will also introduce MLJAR Studio – a user-friendly IDE that combines code, data, and AI in one place. Finally, I will demonstrate Mercury – a tool that turns Jupyter Notebooks into interactive web apps that can be shared with others.

    The talk will be practical, based on real examples, and focused on tools that make everyday research work easier.

  * title: __Generative adversarial neural networks for simulating neutrino interactions__, speaker: dr L. Bonilla

    **Abstract:** We propose a new approach to simulate neutrino scattering events as an alternative to the standard Monte Carlo generator approach. Generative adversarial neural network (GAN) models are developed to simulate neutrino-carbon collisions in the few-GeV energy range. Two GAN models have been obtained: one simulating only quasielastic neutrino-nucleus scatterings and another simulating all interactions at given neutrino energy, trained on NuWro Monte Carlo simulation. The performance of both models has been assessed using two statistical metrics, and it is shown that both GAN models successfully reproduce the event distributions from the training data set.

  * title: __AI in Academia__, speaker: dr R. Durka

    **Abstract:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape teaching and scientific research. We will explore real-world applications of AI tools, from improving various academic aspects and optimizing workflows to enhancing scientific exploration. I will also highlight recent developments and features, including new tools like Canva, voice-enabled AI, autonomous AI agents, deep research, and recent reasoning models.
